# Mood Analysis in Twitter

## Project Description

This project aims to analyze the mood expressed in tweets using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The analysis identifies mood trends in large datasets of tweets by applying machine learning models such as Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machines (SVM). Sentiment analysis techniques, combined with TF-IDF vectorization, help in understanding the underlying emotions conveyed in social media interactions.
